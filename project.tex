\subsection{Haukur's work}

One idea on scoring vectors to, perhaps, capture more realistic preferences.

Three voting rules.

\subsubsection{Capturing interest groups}

Instead of considering the borda scoring vector when maximizing utility we might want to use a vector which gives the
first candidate marginally more points than the second candidate and so on until we reach the middle candidate then the margin
 starts to grow again until it reaches what it was in the beginning. This allows voters to select a few items which they
 "really like" and a few items which they "really hate". Think of $-x^3$.

\subsubsection{Schulze rule}

Has many nice properties and is closely related to the $20\%$ minimal requirement.

Computationally feasible.

\subsubsection{$\Theta$-Smith set}

The $\Theta$-Smith set is the smallest non-empty set of candidates s.t. each member of the set defeats every other member outside
 the set in $\Theta \%$ of cases.

 The $\Theta$-Smith set is a Condorcet extension.

A suggestion of an algorithm which selects a "good" $\Theta$-Smith set. Compute the Smith set for $\Theta=50$
(the normal Smith set), check if it satisfies the cost restricitons. Second, check the upper-bound by finding the Smith
set of $\Theta=100$, if it satisfies the cost restriction, select it. Depending on the case the cost restriction was not
satsfied we need to iterate over the interval in which the cost restriction break, start iterating from $\Theta=50$ and
 increase/decrease $\Theta$ by $(100-50)/2=25$ or $(50-0)/2=25$ until a set is found which satisfies the cost
 restrictions (when found, there might be multiple.).

Computationally feasible.

\subsubsection{K-plurality rule}

The {\em k-plurality rule} with $k<|A|$ is a {\em positional scoring rule} with the same scoring vector as the normal
{\em plurality rule}, $(1,0, \dots, 0)$, but instead of electing the alternative(s) with the highest score it elects the
alternative(s) with the highest score, if the number of winners is strictly less than $k$ then the alternative(s) with
the second highest score is elected. This is done until $|W| \geq k$. If $|W| > k$ then a tie-breaker should be applied
on the last iteration.

Computationally feasible.

\subsubsection{Utility Optimization}
We could also cast the problem of coming up with the best recommendation, given the items' costs as well as the budget, as a maximization problem. What we try to maximize is the sum of all the consumers' values by choosing $W$, where a consumer's value of seeing some item in $W$ is represented by a vector $\boldsymbol{s}$. For each consumer we only count the value from the news items that are actually in the recommended set:\\
\begin{equation}
\max_W \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{i=1}^m \one [a_i\in W] V(\mathbf{R}, n_j, a_i)
\end{equation}

Of course, Equation 1 is trivially solved by $W=A$. But the interest in solving it comes from adding the budget constraint.
\begin{equation}
\max_W \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{i=1}^m \one [a_i\in W] V(\mathbf{R}, n_j, a_i) \text{ subject to } \sum_{a_i \in W} C(a_i) \leq B
\end{equation}

This problem, however, is the well-studied {\em 0-1 Knapsack} problem. Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, what is the most valuable knapsack that you can put together without exceeding its maximal load. In our case the weight corresponds to an article's cost, the value to the sum of all consumers' value if the item is included in $W$, and the maximal load corresponds to our budget $B$. 

Although the optimization problem is NP-hard, there exists pseudo-polynomial algorithms using dynamic programming as well as polynomial-time approximation schemes.
