\section{Introduction: Goal \& Motivation}
Our project aims at better understanding of collective recommendation mechanisms in media settings. We want to use formal tools provided by Social Choice Theory to analyze benefits and drawbacks of various possible ways to determine a set of essential news items - eg. newspaper articles - for a group, given each member's individual preferences over the topics - eg. politics, sport, business - instantiated by the items.

News consumers only have so much time and cognitive ressources at their disposal, yet receiving information through news requires both of these. At the same time, it is easy to see the desirability of people - as members in a community or citizens in a state- to be on the same page with respect to topics of high concern to other members. It is, therefore, important to get on understanding of how extract a common core of pieces of information from the dispersed interests and pet topics of individuals while, at the same, time respecting the constraints given by attention span and time.

\section{Formal Model}
The formal model we will base our anaylisis looks as follows:\\
Given a set of voters/readers $N$ a set of candidates/news items $A$ and a corresponding profile $\mathbf{R}$ we want to fill a set of indispensable $M$. We do this by sequentially applying a resolute voting rule $F:\mathcal{L}(A)^n \rightarrow A$ for $|M|=m$ times. \textcolor{red}{For each step in the sequence we remove the previous step's winner. (Do we need to make this restriction already? there might be a voting rule that funny stuff when we do this)} This process is constrained by an attention budget $b\in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ for each player. Each item $a\in A$ is associated with a cost $c_a\in \mathbb{R_{\geq 0}}$ and if $M=\{a_1,...,a_m\}$ then $\sum_1^m a_i \leq b$. The cardinality of $M$ thus depends on the items' cost and the composition of $M$.

\section{Avenues of Analysis} 
There are two paths we want to explore in terms of analysis:
\begin{enumerate}
\item As our hope ultimately is to come up with an SCF that provides us with a \textit{good} $M$, given some $\mathbf{R}$ in the context of media, we must qualify what \textit{good} means here. The obvious choice for this task are axiomatic tools from Social Choice Theory. We thus want to determine a set of desiderata a set of indispensable items $M$ should satisfy with respect to a profile $\mathbf{R}$. By way of illustration, one such axiom for $M$ could demand that any item that is present in the $90^th$ percentile for all readers, must be present in $M$.
We also hope to find some interaction between axiomatic choices at the level of SCF and $M$.
\item Instead of taking the axiomatic approach we could view the problem as minimizing some sort of discrepancy between $M$ and what the readers' preferences are, while respecting the budget constraint. Intuitively, such a discrepancy would be captured by a metric that, to give an example, indicates high discrepancy if the unanimous top-priority in the profile is not present in $M$ and lower discrepancy if the unanimous bottom-priority is absent. Our problem then becomes the challenge to find a voting rule procedure that yields the subset of $A$ - $M$ that minimizes discrepancy while staying within the budget.
\end{enumerate}
